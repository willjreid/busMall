Bus Mall Project

This project was delivered for CodeFellows 201 on behalf of client Bus Mall.  Bus Mall is interested in selling items to riders/customers, and this project allows the client to determine which items are most appealing to current customers.  

## For Developers
This project consists of an HTML framework to display three images at a time, based on a hard-coded product catalog listed and called from a javascript file.  The constructor requires a product name, a path to the file that is its image, and an id.
